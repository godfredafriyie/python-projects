# Python Projects – Applied to Project Management

This repository demonstrates how a **Technical Project Manager** applies Python to enhance delivery efficiency, automate data checks, and drive decision-making accuracy.

Each script transforms a fundamental programming concept into a practical **project management use case** — from tracking metrics and budgets to simulating risk and performance models.  
It reflects my ability to understand both the technical and analytical sides of modern project delivery.


# Python Projects for Technical Project Management

This collection of Python scripts demonstrates how I apply coding logic to streamline project workflows, automate analysis, and support decision-making as a Technical Project Manager.  
Each script represents a small, real-world use case that blends Agile delivery insight with data-driven execution.

| File | PM Use Case | Technical Function | Outcome |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Performance Tracker.py – Performance Tracker** | Automates student or team performance evaluation during sprints or training programs. | Control flow, input validation, conditional logic | Enables quick reporting on pass/fail metrics and productivity outcomes. |
| **Comparative KPI Checker.py – Comparative KPI Checker** | Compares two key performance indicators or metrics from different reporting periods. | Relational and logical operations | Helps PMs identify improvement trends or areas needing escalation. |
| **Data Input Parser.py – Data Input Parser** | Validates and decomposes structured identifiers (e.g., task codes, IDs). | String and integer manipulation | Reduces manual entry errors and ensures data cleanliness in reports. |
| **Budget Accrual Simulator.py – Budget Accrual Simulator** | Models incremental savings or funding milestones for project budgets. | While loops, cumulative logic | Tracks goal completion progress and budget thresholds dynamically. |
| **Risk Prioritization Model.py – Risk Prioritization Model** | Determines smallest and second-smallest values (e.g., risk scores). | Nested conditionals | Assists PMs in ranking low-impact vs. medium-impact risks. |
| **Workload Allocator.py – Workload Allocator** | Categorizes resource assignments or workload distribution. | Iteration, list operations | Helps maintain balanced task loads and fair sprint planning. |
| **Issue Escalation Tracker.py – Issue Escalation Tracker** | Records issue severities and categorizes escalation tiers. | Loop and counter logic | Facilitates tracking of blocker frequencies across sprints. |
| **Metrics Normalizer.py – Metrics Normalizer** | Cleans and normalizes collected numeric data for reporting. | Range checks and input validation | Ensures KPI data integrity for dashboards. |
| **Quality Compliance Validator.py – Quality Compliance Validator** | Validates quality assurance test results against acceptance thresholds. | Nested conditionals, validation logic | Supports data-driven Go/No-Go deployment decisions. |
| **Sprint Summary Generator.py – Sprint Summary Generator** | Aggregates performance data and outputs summary reports. | Loop, condition, accumulation | Provides quick end-of-sprint summaries for retrospectives. |
